# Introduction #

The Propeller GCC Library is an implementation of the standard C library. It attempts to conform to the C89 version of the standard, with some C99 extensions. This documentation assumes that the user is familiar with the C language and C libraries; we will focus on the Propeller specific details of this library rather than general usage.
