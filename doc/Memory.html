<BODY>
<H1>Memory Models</H1>

<P>The Propeller port of GCC supports a
number of memory models, or ways of storing the program in memory.
Basically these models provide a trade off of speed for code space.
By far the fastest model is the native “cog” model (<CODE>-mcog</CODE>)
in which machine instructions are executed directly. However, in that
model only the 2K of internal memory (actually slightly less) is
available for code. In the other models (LMM, CMM, XMMC, and XMM) code is
stored in RAM external to the cog and is loaded in by a small kernel.
This makes more space available for the code (and, in the XMM case,
the data) but at the cost of having kernel overhead on each
instruction executed.</P>

<H2>COG</H2>

<P>As previously mentioned, in the COG
memory model code is stored directly in the internal memory of the
Propeller's cogs. This memory is 512 words, or 2048 bytes, long, but
16 words are reserved for hardware registers. The GNU C compiler
reserves an additional 17 words for compiler registers. These
registers, named <CODE>r0</CODE>-<CODE>r14</CODE>,<CODE>
lr</CODE>, and <CODE>sp</CODE>, are used by the
compiler for various purposes. <CODE>r0</CODE>-<CODE>r7</CODE>
are temporary registers within a function (not preserved across
function calls). <CODE>r8</CODE>-<CODE>r14</CODE>
are working registers within a function and are preserved across
function calls. <CODE>lr</CODE> is the “link
register” which holds the return address for functions (except for
functions declared with the “native” attribute, for which the
return address is stored directly in the <CODE>ret</CODE>
instruction). <CODE>sp</CODE> is the stack pointer.</P>

<H3>Assembly programming in COG mode</H3>

<P>Inline assembly (or writing external C
callable functions in assembly) in COG mode is very straightforward –
the Propeller instruction set is directly usable. The GNU assembler
gas accepts input that is very similar to PASM. The major differences
are: (1) gas does not understand local labels (labels that start with
<CODE>:</CODE>), and (2) by default addresses are considered to be byte addresses
rather than word addresses; you can tell gas to treat them as words
by using the <CODE>.cog_ram</CODE> directive. The
instruction set is the same, although for convenience gas offers a
<CODE>mova</CODE> (“move address”) instruction
that works just like <CODE>mov</CODE> but which
divides any immediate source value by 4, thus converting it from a
byte address to a word address. <CODE>mova</CODE> is
not needed in .cog_ram mode, but is convenient in the default
mode.</P>

<H2>LMM</H2>
<P>In the Large Memory Model (LMM mode),
the program code is stored in hub memory, which is 32K in size. The
program's data and stack are also stored there. A small kernel
program (the “LMM Kernel”) runs in COG memory and loads and
executes program instructions from hub memory. In this mode the same
17 compiler registers are available as in hub mode (<CODE>r0</CODE>-<CODE>r14</CODE>,
<CODE>lr</CODE>, and <CODE>sp</CODE>),
but there is an additional register <CODE>pc</CODE>
which is a pointer to the next instruction to be fetched.</P>

<H3>Assembly programming in LMM mode</H3>

<P>In LMM mode most PASM instructions can
be used, except for any jump or call instructions (including <CODE>djnz</CODE>,
<CODE>tjnz</CODE>, and <CODE>jmpret</CODE>).
Instead of doing direct jumps, we have to modify the value of the <CODE>pc</CODE>
register used by the LMM interpreter instead. This may be done either
by directly adding an offset to <CODE>pc</CODE>, or
by loading a new value into it. gas provides a pseudo-instruction <CODE>brs</CODE>
(“branch short”) which translates into an immediate <CODE>add</CODE>
or <CODE>sub</CODE> of the <CODE>pc</CODE>;
this may be used to branch to a destination within 508 bytes (plus or
minus) of the instruction following the <CODE>brs</CODE>.
For longer branches we can use the <CODE>__LMM_JMP</CODE>
routine built into the kernel, or else move a different register into
<CODE>pc</CODE> (for an indirect jump). After the <CODE>jmp
#__LMM_JMP</CODE> instruction comes a 4 byte address indicating the
new value for the <CODE>pc</CODE>.</P>

<P>Calls are handled by the <CODE>__LMM_CALL</CODE>
and <CODE>__LMM_CALL_INDIRECT</CODE> kernel
functions. <CODE>__LMM_CALL</CODE> is like <CODE>__LMM_JMP</CODE>
except that before it loads the new <CODE>pc</CODE>
it saves the old value into the <CODE>lr</CODE>
register. The called function can thus return with a simple <CODE>mov
pc,lr</CODE> instruction. <CODE>__LMM_CALL_INDIRECT</CODE>
uses a special register, <CODE>__TMP0</CODE>, as the
address to call; thus, an indirect call via compiler register <CODE>r6</CODE>
would be coded as:</P>
<P>
<CODE>mov __TMP0, r6</CODE><BR>
<CODE>jmp
#__LMM_CALL_INDIRECT</CODE><BR>
</P>

<P><CODE>__LMM_CALL_INDIRECT</CODE>
also saves the return address in <CODE>lr</CODE>.</P>

<H2>XMMC</H2>

<P>In the eXtended Memory Model – Code
(XMMC mode) the program code is stored in external memory, either
flash or ram. The exact size of this memory depends on the board
used, but it is generally quite a bit larger than hub memory. The
program's data and stack reside in hub memory as in LMM mode.</P>
<P>Assembly programming in XMMC mode is
exactly the same as in LMM mode.</P>

<H2>XMM</H2>

<P>In the eXtended Memory Model both the
code and data are placed in external memory (in the case of data it
must be an external RAM). This allows for the largest possible
programs, but at a considerable cost in execution time, since all
data accesses must go through functions in the XMM kernel. As in all
other modes, the stack remains in hub memory (and hence is limited to
32K bytes less the cache size used by the XMM kernel, which is
typically 8K bytes).</P>

<P>Assembly programming in XMM mode is
very similar to LMM mode, except that data accesses which may point
into external memory must be done via the appropriate kernel
functions instead of directly with <CODE>rdlong</CODE>
and <CODE>wrlong</CODE> instructions.</P>

<H2>CMM</H2>

<P>
There is a special memory model called the "compressed memory
model" (CMM). This model is the same as the LMM model in that code
and data are both stored in hub memory. The difference is that in CMM
mode code is compressed in a special format that takes less space, and
decompressed by the kernel at run time. This saves space, but at the
cost of execution speed.
</P>


<H1>Kernel APIs</H1>

<P>The kernels all
provide some common functions which may be used by programs (and
which the compiler takes advantage of).</P>

<P>
  Note that the GAS assembler has macros built in which provide a
  "short form" of some of the calls below. In the compressed memory
  model (if -mcmm is used) these short forms are actualy stored
  compressed in the instruction stream.
</P>

<H2>Data movement</H2>

<P>
<CODE>jmp #__LMM_MVI_rn</CODE><BR>
<CODE>long val</CODE><BR>
</P>
<P>This is a “move immediate”
instruction to move the value “val” into compiler register <CODE>rn</CODE>
(or the link register <CODE>lr</CODE>). After the
instruction is complete the LMM interpreter resumes automatically.</P>
<P>
short form:
<CODE>mvil rn, #val</CODE>
<br>or <CODE>mviw rn, #val</CODE> if val is known to fit in 16 bits
</P>
<br>

<P>
<CODE>mov __TMP0,
#(count&lt;&lt;4)|regnum</CODE><BR>
<CODE>call #__LMM_PUSHM</CODE><BR>
</P>
<P>Push multiple compiler registers onto
the stack. “count” is the number of registers to push, and
“regnum” is the number of the first register to push (0 for <CODE>r0</CODE>,
1 for <CODE>r1</CODE>, and so on; register number 15
is <CODE>lr</CODE>). Note that “count+regnum”
should be less than or equal to 16. The registers count up, so if
regnum is 12 and count is 3 then <CODE>r12</CODE>,
<CODE>r13</CODE>, and <CODE>r14</CODE>
will be pushed (in that order).</P>
<P>short form:
<CODE>pushm #(count&lt;&lt;4)|regnum</CODE><BR>
</P>
<br>

<P>
<CODE>mov __TMP0,
#(count&lt;&lt;4)|regnum</CODE><BR>
<CODE>call #__LMM_POPM</CODE> or call #__LMM_POPRET<BR>
</P>
<P>Pop multiple compiler registers from
the stack. “count” is the number of registers to pop, and
“regnum” is the number of the first register to pop, which should
be the last register pushed (0 for <CODE>r0</CODE>, 1
for <CODE>r1</CODE>, and so on). Note that
“count+regnum” should be less than or equal to 16. The registers
count down, so if regnum is 14 and count is 3 then <CODE>r14</CODE>,
<CODE>r13</CODE>, and <CODE>r12</CODE>
will be popped (in that order).</P>
<P>If <CODE>__LMM_POPRET</CODE> is used then a <CODE>mov pc,lr</CODE>
  will be issued right after the pop
</P>

<P>short form:
<CODE>popm #(count&lt;&lt;4)|regnum</CODE><BR>
or <CODE>popret #(count&lt;&lt;4)|regnum</CODE><BR>
</P>
<br>

<H2>Branches and calls</H2>

<P>
<CODE>jmp #__LMM_JMP</CODE><BR>
<CODE>long addr</CODE><BR>
</P>
<P>Moves the immediate value <CODE>addr</CODE>
into the <CODE>pc</CODE> register (so the LMM
interpreter will begin to execute at address <CODE>addr</CODE>,
thus performing an unconditional jump).</P>
</P>
<P>short form:
<CODE>brl #addr</CODE><BR>
</P>
<br>

<P>
<CODE>jmp #__LMM_CALL</CODE><BR>
<CODE>long addr</CODE><BR>
</P>
<P>Moves the address of the next
instruction into the <CODE>lr</CODE> register, and
moves <CODE>addr</CODE> into the <CODE>pc</CODE>
register (so the LMM interpreter will begin execution at address
<CODE>addr</CODE>, which is typically a subroutine).</P>
<P>
<P>short form:
<CODE>lcall #addr</CODE><BR>
</P>
<br>

<CODE>mov __TMP0,rn</CODE><BR>
<CODE>jmp #__LMM_CALL_INDIRECT</CODE><BR>
</P>
<P>Moves the address of the next
instruction into the <CODE>lr</CODE> register, and
moves <CODE>__TMP0</CODE> into the <CODE>pc</CODE>
register (so the LMM interpreter will begin execution at address, it
contained, which is typically a subroutine).</P>

<H2>Math functions</H2>

<P>
<CODE>call #__UDIVSI</CODE>
</P>
<P>Performs 32 bit unsigned division of
the value in compiler register <CODE>r0</CODE> by the one in
<CODE>r1</CODE>. Returns the
quotient in <CODE>r0</CODE>, and the remainder in <CODE>r1</CODE>.</P>

<P><CODE>call #__DIVSI</CODE></P>
<P>Performs a 32 bit signed division of <CODE>r0</CODE>
by <CODE>r1</CODE>. Returns the quotient in <CODE>r0</CODE>,
and the remainder in <CODE>r1</CODE>. The sign of the remainder is
chosen so as to be consistent with the C standard.
</P>

<P><CODE>call #__MULSI</CODE></P>
<P>Multiplies the two 32 bit numbers in <CODE>r0</CODE>
and <CODE>r1</CODE>, and returns the (low order) 32 bits of the result in <CODE>r0</CODE>.</P>

<P><CODE>call #__CLZSI</CODE></P>

<P>Counts the number of leading 0 bits in
register <CODE>r0</CODE>, and returns the result in <CODE>r0</CODE>. For example, if <CODE>r0</CODE> =
0x00008100, then the result will be 16. This is useful for
normalizing fixed and floating point numbers.</P>

<P><CODE>call #__CTZSI</CODE></P>

<P>Counts the number of trailing 0 bits in
register <CODE>r0</CODE>, and returns the result in <CODE>r0</CODE>. For example, if <CODE>r0</CODE> =
0x00008100, then the result will be 8.</P>

<H2>Miscellaneous functions</H2>

<P>
<CODE>
jmp #__LMM_FCACHE_LOAD<BR>
long nbytes
</CODE></P>

<P>
Loads some code into the fast cache and executes
it. The code to be loaded and executed immediately follows the load
sequence, and is <CODE>nbytes</CODE> bytes long (which must be a
multiple of 4).

Code executing in the fast cache must use only COG instructions, and
must not refer to the program counter <CODE>pc</CODE>
(<CODE>jmp</CODE> instructions must be used instead, with labels
referring to the COG memory region starting
at <CODE>__LMM_FCACHE_START</CODE>, which is where it will be executed
from. At the end of the fastcached block should come a <CODE>jmp
__LMM_RET</CODE> instruction (note that this is an indirect jump).
</P>
<P>
For example, the C strcpy function:
</P>
<PRE>
char *strcpy(char *dst_orig, const char *src) {
    char *dst = dst_orig;
    while ((*dst++ = *src++) != 0)
        ;
    return dst_orig;
}
</PRE>
<P>
is translated by the compiler into code using the fast cache like:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
	.global	_strcpy
_strcpy
	mov	r7, r0
	jmp	#__LMM_FCACHE_LOAD
	long	.L6-.L5
.L5
.L2
	rdbyte	r6, r1
	cmp	r6, #0 wz
	add	r1, #1
	wrbyte	r6, r7
	add	r7, #1
	IF_NE	jmp	#__LMM_FCACHE_START+(.L2-.L5)
	jmp	__LMM_RET
.L6
	mov	pc,lr
</PRE>
