release/INSTALL.txt

Current instructions are for command line users.
Integrated package installs will be available later.


1. Propeller GCC Linux install:

To install Propeller GCC on linux: unpack the tar file in some
suitable location. I use /opt/parallax, but that requires root access;
you can also use your home directory.

Add /opt/parallax/bin (or $HOME/parallax/bin, as appropriate)
to your PATH. 

Move demo files to some working directory.

$ PATH=/opt/parallax/bin:$PATH
$ mv demo ~/.


2. Propeller GCC Windows install:

The install procedure for Windows with an installer will be in a different package.
Please follow instructions in README_WINDOWS.txt to install.


3. Propeller GCC Cygwin install:

The install procedure for Windows/Cygwin with an installer is in a different package.
Please follow instructions in README_CYGWIN.txt to install.


4. Propeller GCC MAC OSX install:

A MAC OSX distribution is not available yet.
